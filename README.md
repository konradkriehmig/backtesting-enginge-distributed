!!!WIP!!!

Aim of this project is to improve the runtime of multiple parallel backtests that take my laptop too long to run.

How to deploy this project:
1) Clone repo
2) Configure secrets in settigs:
AZURE_CREDENTIALS
POSTGRES_NAME
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
SSH_PUBLIC_KEY
STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME (only lowercase letter)
VM_NAME

THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NOT ABOUT THE TRADING STRATEGY!
 
simple ma crossover backtest on crypto data.

The objective is not to maximize return but to show the limits of the infrastructure that the algo is running on.

I use crypto as a data source because it is freely available. The data ingestion can be replaced with other data anytime.


Running multiple backtests on my laptop:

Took me 15 minutes to backtest all "strategies".
